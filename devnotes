Requirements:
Input: the name of a compound in Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System (SMILES) format.
Output: the name of that compound in IUPAC Nomenclature.

- handle the class of organic compounds known as alkanes (simple hydrocarbons) 
- handle straight-chain and branched alkanes, i.e. no cyclics 
- for the SMILES input, you don't need to worry about reading H, just Carbons (use the simplified syntax that assumes Hydrogens are implied).  
- However, you will need to handle branching notation (parens).

Example inputs:
C
CCC
CC(CC)C
C(C(C))C
CCCC(C)CCCC(CC)CCCC(CCC)CCCC(C)CC
etc..
